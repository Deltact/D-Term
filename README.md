# D-Term
The useless terminal program

What's the point of this you ask? Well... honestly. 
None really.

This repo serves as a joke creation, where I have scraped online some code snippets I've previously used in my projects.

Of course, the solutions provided here are rather niche, but it exists in hopes that it helps "somebody", even if it's just that 1 dev somewhere.
Even if his creation will not serve many people or merely just them specifically, as long as this repo provided some code to that single developer who couldn't find a solution online, is a mission success.

### Why is it a program?
Mostly to demonstrate what code it provides, one can download the exe file provided in the releases and if you find a feature you fancy, you can copy the code snippet that makes it possible.
Use it to your projects and continue with your objective.

## Meet the competitor, [C-Term](https://github.com/ceyhunveyselism/c-term)
C-Term is the theoretical nemesis of D-Term, while D-Term was created first, back in 9th of Dec 2021, C-Term exists for the mere purpose to topple
the functional edge over D-Term and is the only reason why this repository exists.

C-Term & D-Term will be independently developed, for however long our motivation lasts, always outdoing the other.
